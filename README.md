> A cobra CLI inspired by [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)

- **[diff]** two input string fast & clear.
- **[flatten]** shortened URL for safety check.

## why []?

### [diff]

is complex to use in daily scenarios like hash check, eth address match, and compare passphrase. tools like cmp and diff, do it line by line, and need multiple steps(save each strings to file -> compare -> del tmp file)
